## Description

This library base on (https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/fixed_point) library .
provide a header-only C++11 API for approximating real numbers using binary fixed-point arithmetic and build python extension.**There are still some constant efficiencies to be optimizedã€‚**
This project split number to low,high ,and do not need int128 support.
Support basic arithmetic operations(+-*/,sqrt,sin ....etc), view details from test.

## Download

The library is [hosted](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/fixed_point) on GitHub:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AnHeBridge/fixed_point.git
```

The API is exposed through headers in the [include](./include/) directory. Add this to your system header list and include, e.g.:

```c++
#include <sg14/fixed_point>
```
Use in python
```python
from fix32 import fix32
a = fix32(100.5)
```

## Build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run Tests
```
cd build
cmake .. -Dgtest_build_samples=ON
make
ctest -VV
cp fix32.so ../test/
cd ../test/
python test.py
```
